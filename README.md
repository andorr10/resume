## Personal

I enjoy doing things to stay active like hiking and playing soccer or beach volleyball; I’m also a member to the cult
of Crossfit, but don’t adhere to the first rule of Crossfit of always having to talk about it. My friends and I made a virtual
book club that meets online since were spread across the country, the current book is Soonish: 10 emerging technologies
that will improve and/or ruin everything. My favorite countries I’ve traveled to so far have been Belize and Iceland.
